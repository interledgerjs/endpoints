 * This module defines interfaces modelled on Node's native stream interfaces but for

 * The difference is therefor that when writing to a `WritableRequestStream` the writer is returned
 * a Promise that will resolve to a reply.
 *
 * The current version of the interfaces assumes that implementations are not buffering so functions such as
 * `pause` and `resume` and properties such as `readable`, `writable` etc. are not defined.
